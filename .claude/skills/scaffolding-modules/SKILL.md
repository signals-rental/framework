# Scaffolding New Domain Modules

Builds a **complete vertical slice** the way Members was built. A module is not "done" when the model and API exist — it is done when the list page, record page, admin config, permissions, events/webhooks, global search, docs, and tests all exist and the quality gate passes. Partial slices are the #1 failure mode this skill prevents.

**Exemplar:** Members (`app/Models/Member.php` and everything around it). Where Phase-2 modules (Products, Activities) use a newer pattern, follow them instead — deltas are listed in `references/members-exemplar.md`.

## When to Apply

- User asks for a new module, entity, model, or "new part of the system" with UI and/or API.
- A framework-plans phase calls for a new domain slice.
- User asks to check, audit, or gap-analyse an existing module against framework conventions.
- NOT for: single new fields, new endpoints on existing modules, admin-only reference tables (those need only a subset — but still check the Definition of Done for which subset).

## Modes

Determine from the request (ask if ambiguous):

**`new`** — building a module from scratch. Follow Phase 0 and the build phases in order. This is the default when the entity does not exist yet.

**`existing`** — gap-audit a module that already exists (fully or partly built). Do NOT start building. Instead:

1. Run Phase 0 steps 1–5 (the review gate) for that module's domain.
2. Walk EVERY item in `references/checklist.md` and grade it against the codebase: **present** (evidence: file path), **partial** (what's there / what's not), or **missing**. The list-sync registrations table and admin-surfaces table in `references/members-exemplar.md` are the verification map — grep each registration point for the module's keys.
3. Save the report to `.claude/reviews/module-audit-{module}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (same convention as oss-maintainer) with a summary table and a prioritised gap list (security/data-integrity gaps first, then API/UI contract gaps, then docs/tests).
4. Present the gap list to the user and offer to close gaps — closing them then follows the relevant `new`-mode phases for just those pieces (including the Phase 0 placement questions if nav/URL/dashboard items are among the gaps).

In `existing` mode the Phase 0 user questions are only asked when the corresponding item is a gap being fixed.

## The Iron Rule: Review Before Building

**No file is created or modified until Phase 0 is complete.** Violating this produces bespoke components, duplicated logic, and missed conventions.

### Phase 0 — Review existing work (mandatory gate)

1. **Read the relevant framework plan(s)** in `framework-plans/` and the matching GitHub discussion(s) — the mapping table is in `references/checklist.md`. The plan may already specify your table's columns, name, or phase (e.g. the scheduling plan already specifies `vehicles`).
2. **Read `framework-plans/data-model-implementation.md`** for the table's phase, column spec, and naming. Check `framework-plans/implementation-proposal.md` + [discussion #20](https://github.com/signals-rental/framework/discussions/20) for whether this module is even in the current phase.
3. **Inventory the exemplar**: skim `references/members-exemplar.md`, then open the actual Members (and Products/Activities) files you will mirror. Do not work from memory of "typical Laravel".
4. **Read `framework-plans/component-library.md`** (and the rendered library at `docs/development` / `/prototypes/component-reference`) before touching any Blade. ALL UI must use the Signals framework components — `<x-signals.*>` containers and `s-*` classes; never build a new table, badge, modal, bulk bar, or any custom styling that duplicates an `s-` component.
5. **Search for prior art**: grep `app/` for similar models/services. If something close exists (e.g. a registry, a trait, a column type), extend it.
6. **Ask the user — never guess — four placement questions** (use AskUserQuestion):
   - **URL placement:** root level (`/vehicles`) or within a section (`/resources/vehicles`)?
   - **Nav placement:** top-level entry, or inside an existing mega-menu section (e.g. CRM, Resources)?
   - **Dashboard widget:** does this module need a dashboard component built and placed on the dashboard?
   - **Dashboard quick action:** should a quick action (e.g. "New {Entity}") be added to the dashboard Quick Actions block?
7. **Write a short scope note** (5–10 lines: entity name, table columns, archive semantics, relationships, URL/nav placement, which phases of the checklist apply) and confirm direction with the user if anything is ambiguous — especially archive semantics and whether merge applies.

### Key decisions to make in Phase 0

| Decision | Options | Rule of thumb |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Archive semantics | Soft delete + `is_active` (Members) vs `is_active` only | Soft deletes ONLY for major business entities (members, opportunities, invoices). Either way the list page gets Active/Archived/All filtering and Archive/Restore actions. |
| Type taxonomy | PHP enum vs `list_values` | Enum when workflow-bound (status); list-of-values when user-extensible (categories, types). |
| Merge ability | Yes/No | Yes for entities users create duplicates of (members, products). Mirror `MergeMember`/`MergeModal`. |
| Polymorphic relations | Explicit FKs vs MorphTo | Newer modules (Activities) use MorphTo `regarding`-style maps. |
| Store scoping | `store_id` FK or not | Per data-model plan; store-scoped models get a global scope. |

## Build Phases (after Phase 0)

Work in this order; each phase lists its acceptance in `references/checklist.md` and its copy-from files in `references/members-exemplar.md`.

1. **Data model** — migration (industry-standard RMS-compatible names, integer PK, UTC timestamps, JSONB for flexible config, FKs constrained + indexed, money as INTEGER minor units), model (`casts()` method, `HasCustomFields`, `HasAttachments` if files apply, implements `HasSchema` with `defineSchema()`), factory with states. **Seeders, two kinds:** system/reference data in its own seeder registered in `DatabaseSeeder::run()` (the first-run seeder); demo records in `DemoDataSeeder` (`signals:seed-demo`) tagged `'demo-data'` in `tag_list` so `signals:clear-demo` can remove them.
2. **Actions + DTOs + events** — one invocable action per operation that occurs (no inline mutations anywhere), `Gate::authorize` inside; **every mutation fires `AuditableEvent` and dispatches its webhook event** (create/update/archive/restore/delete/merge + domain verbs). Each `AuditableEvent` must produce an `action_logs` row surfaced in `/admin/settings/action-log` — assert this in tests. Spatie Data DTOs only — never Form Requests or API Resources.
3. **API** — thin controller using `FiltersQueries` + `ResourceActions` traits ($allowedFilters, $filterAliases, $allowedSorts, $allowedIncludes, $customFieldModule); `apiResource` routes + nested resources; Sanctum abilities `{resource}:read`/`{resource}:write` registered in the token-ability picker; `view_id` custom-view support via `applyViewOrFilters()`; Scramble PHPDoc.
4. **List-sync registrations** (the silent-failure zone — see red flags): `SchemaController::MODEL_MAP`, `WebhookService::EVENTS`, custom-field module list, `PermissionSeeder` + `RoleSeeder`, `ViewSeeder` system views, `DatabaseSeeder` (first-run) + `DemoDataSeeder`, token-ability picker, and — if the module should be user-toggleable — the admin Modules page (`$moduleDefinitions` in `resources/views/livewire/admin/settings/modules.blade.php`) plus every `FeatureProfile::modules()` preset map.
5. **List page** — Volt page at `resources/views/livewire/{plural}/index.blade.php` + `app/Views/{Entity}ColumnRegistry.php`. Must include the full datatable contract: shared `<livewire:components.data-table>` (multiselect, sortable columns, avatars/entity icons, pagination), `toolbar-view` (type-filter chips with counts, Active/Archived/All filter, `<x-signals.column-toggle />`, `<x-signals.export-button />`), `actions-view` row-actions ellipsis, `bulk-actions-view` with `<x-signals.bulk-bar>` (archive + merge when applicable), merge modal, archive confirm modal, search, custom-view selector. 3–5 system views seeded in `ViewSeeder`.
6. **Record (show) page** — `<x-signals.page-header>` (breadcrumbs, type/status meta badges, Edit link, split-button "New" quick-actions menu linking to every relevant sub-model create), tabs for each related model listing, activity timeline, files/attachments tab, custom-fields tab.
7. **Form page** — single Volt form for create + edit (own routes per CRUD conventions: `/{plural}/create`, `/{plural}/{id}/edit`), constructs DTO → calls the same action the API uses, renders custom fields from definitions.
8. **Admin panels & admin surfaces** — settings definition class + registry entry if the module has configuration; reference-data CRUD pages under `/settings` (permission-gated) for any config tables; admin custom-fields module dropdown. Then make the module visible in every relevant admin surface: permissions appear in `admin/settings/permissions` + `roles` (via `PermissionRegistry` registration in `AppServiceProvider`), API scopes in the `admin/settings/api` ability list, seeded email templates in `admin/settings/email-templates`, registered notification types in `admin/settings/notifications`, scheduling-relevant settings in the `scheduling` settings group/page, LOV lists in `admin/settings/list-names`. See the admin-surfaces table in `references/members-exemplar.md`.
9. **Permissions** — `{resource}.access/view/create/edit/delete` chain in `PermissionSeeder`, assigned to every seeded role in `RoleSeeder`, Policy via `AuthorizesByPermission` trait.
10. **Search, nav + dashboard** — permission-gated block in `app/Http/Controllers/Web/SearchController.php` (global search results), command palette Navigation + Create entries AND search-result wiring, header mega-menu + sidebar entry in `resources/views/components/layouts/app/header.blade.php` gated on `{resource}.access` (placement per the Phase 0 answers). If requested in Phase 0: dashboard widget as a Livewire component in `app/Livewire/Dashboard/` placed in `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`, and/or a quick action in the dashboard Quick Actions block — both permission-gated.
11. **Docs** — new pages: `docs/platform/{slug}.md` + `docs/api/{slug}.md` + `docs/documentation.json` manifest entries (use the **generate-docs** skill for format). Existing pages to UPDATE: `docs/api/webhooks.md` `## Events` list (new webhook events), `docs/getting-started/seeders.md` (any new seeders + DatabaseSeeder table), `docs/platform/admin-panel.md` (any admin panel changes/additions), `docs/development/getting-started.md` (if developer-facing setup/conventions changed). **All finished changes recorded in `docs/changelog/{next-version}.md`** — not optional.
12. **Tests + quality gate** — 90% line coverage target: actions (direct invocation + `Event::fake`), API (CRUD, abilities, Ransack `_eq`-family only on SQLite, includes, custom-field shape, validation), policy matrix per role, model (casts/scopes/schema), Livewire pages, seeder meta-tests. Then the mandatory gate: tests → `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` → `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` → pr-review agents → fix and repeat. Ask before committing.

## Global Engines — Never Reinvent

If the module touches any of these concerns, it MUST use the existing global engine — a module-local alternative is always wrong:

| Concern | Use | Never |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Tax | Global `TaxRate`/`TaxRule` + product/org tax classes (`admin/settings/tax`), `TaxCalculator` | Module-local tax columns or rates |
| Currency | Global `Currency` + `ExchangeRate` (`CurrencyService`), `currency_code` + rate snapshot on financial rows | Hardcoded currencies, float money |
| Countries | Seeded ISO `countries` table | Module-local country lists |
| Anything priced by time/quantity | `RateDefinition` presets + `ProductRate` pattern, `RateResolver`/`RateCalculator` (`admin/settings/rate-definitions`) | A parallel pricing/rate mechanism |
| Outbound email content | DB-stored `EmailTemplate` (seeded, editable in admin) | Hardcoded mail bodies |
| User-extensible dropdowns | `list_names`/`list_values` (admin-editable) | Hardcoded option arrays |

## Red Flags — STOP, you are about to ship a partial slice

| Rationalization | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "A table with search and pagination is enough for the list page" | The list contract is the FULL datatable: ColumnRegistry, custom views, column toggle, export, multiselect + bulk bar, row-actions ellipsis, archive filters, merge. Members shows every piece. |
| "Docs can come later / in another PR" | Docs are part of the slice (org principle: docs at parity with code). Platform doc + API doc + manifest entry, every time. |
| "Command-palette nav entry covers search" | Global search means a `SearchController` block + palette search results, not just a nav shortcut. |
| "I'll skip merge/archive for v1" | Decide in Phase 0 with the user, don't silently drop. Archive filtering is always required. |
| "I'll register webhooks/schema later" | UAT defects D5/D6 were exactly this. Phase 4's list-sync registrations are graded items in the checklist. |
| "I remember how members works" | Open the files. Patterns drifted between Phase 1 and Phase 2 (MorphTo, enums, SchemaRegistry). |
| "I'll add a NavigationService entry" | `NavigationService` does not exist yet despite docs mentioning it — nav lives in `header.blade.php` and the command palette. Verify against the codebase, not the plans. |
| "This component doesn't exist, I'll build it" | Check `framework-plans/component-library.md` and `resources/views/components/signals/` first. It almost certainly exists. |

## Definition of Done

Every box in `references/checklist.md` ticked, suite green, pint + phpstan clean, pr-review run. If a layer is intentionally skipped (e.g. no merge for an asset register), the decision is recorded in the PR/scratchpad — silence is not a decision.
